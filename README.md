## Julia API to Quandl 

[Quandl.com](http://www.quandl.com) is a lightweight interface to over nine million open-source datasets. This package creates an easy interface to obtain and manipulate these datasets, using TimeArrays or DataFrames, as well as letting the user search for data.

````julia
Pkg.add("Quandl")
````

## Getting data

The `quandl` (or `quandlget`) function takes one positional argument (the Quandl code for the database you wish to download) and currently supports six keyword arguments:

- `order`, which is the order in which the returned Dataset is sorted (default is `des`);
- `rows`, which is the number of rows that the returned Dataset will have (default is `100`);
- `frequency`, which is the frequency desired for the Dataset (default is `daily`);
- `transformation`, which is the calculation Quandl do to to Dataset prior to download (default is `none`);
- `start_date`, which is the starting date for the Dataset (default is `""`);
- `end_date`, which is the ending date for the Dataset (default is `""`);
- `auth_key`, which is user's API key (see the next section for further information);
- `format`, which is the type returned by the function (default is `"TimeArray"`, but you can use `"DataFrame"` also).

````julia

## Searching data

You can search the quandl database using the `quandlsearch` function. This function supports one positional argument (the string you are searching for), and four keyword arguments:

- `page`, which  is the page returned by the search (default is `1`);
- `results`, which is the number of the results per-page (default is `20`);
- `quiet`, which indicates whether the function prints information on screen or not (default is `false`);
- `format`, which is the datatype where output is aggregated (default is `"DataFrame"`, but you can also use `"Dict"`).

```julia
julia> df = quandlsearch("GDP USA", results=30)
Returning 30 results of 746200 from page 1
30x5 DataFrame
|-------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Col # | Name      | Eltype      | Missing |

A dictionary datatype is also supported. 

```julia
julia> s = quandlsearch("GDP USA", format="Dict"); # Here 's' is an array of dictionaries

julia> s[1] # This first dictionary looks ugly on REPL
["from_date"=>"1960-12-31","code"=>"USA_NY_GDP_MKTP_CN","name"=>"United States: GDP (current LCU)","source_code"=>"WORLDBANK","id"=>2582933,"updated_at"=>"2014-05-17T12:32:40Z","private"=>false,"description"=>"GDP at purchaser's prices is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products.

julia> s[1]["name"]

julia> s[1]["updated_at"]

```

On the REPL, however, the environment is printed with colors, so it's easier to read.

This function supports one positional argument (the string you are searching for), and eight keyword arguments:

- `page`, which  is the page returned by the search (default is `page=1`);
- `results`, which is the number of the results per-page (default is  `results=20`);
- `order`, which is the order in which the returned Dataset is sorted (default is `des`);
- `rows`, which is the number of rows that the returned Dataset will have (default is `100`);
- `frequency`, which is the frequency desired for the Dataset (default is `daily`);
- `transformation`, which is the calculation Quandl do to to Dataset prior to download (default is `none`);
- `auth_key`, which is user's API key (see the next section for further information);
- `format`, which is the type returned by the function (default is `"TimeArray"`, but you can use `"DataFrame"` also)

## Setting your API key

You can use this package without an auth token, but it's recommended you get one from Quandl.com, since you are limited to 10 downloads per day
without it. Once you get a token (creating an account on Quandl is enough), you'll only need to replace the text in the `src/token/auth_token.jl` file with your unique token. Don't leave any whitespace or extra lines. Every time you upgrade or re-install this package, you'll need to do this extra step.

An another way of doing this, is by using the `set_auth_token` function:

```julia
julia> set_auth_token("1234567890") # You pass a string with your API key to this function
```

The package will use your unique token automatically, or if you choose to remain anonymous and don't care about more than 10 downloads per day, it
will make an anonymous call.

You can also call `quandl` function using the `auth_token` argument. That way, the program will use it instead of the token stored on the file, if you have one.
