## Julia API to Quandl 

[Quandl.com](http://www.quandl.com) is a lightweight interface to over seven million open-source datasets. 

You can use this package without an auth token, but it's recommended you get one from Quandl.com. You are limited to 10 downloads per day
without your unique token. Once you get a token, you'll only need to replace the text in the `src/token/auth_token.jl` file with your unique 
token. Don't leave any whitespace or extra lines.  Every time you upgrade or re-install this package, you'll need to do this extra step. 

The package will use your unique token automatically, or if you choose to remain anonymous and don't care about more than 10 downloads per day, it
will make an anonymous call. 

````julia
Pkg.add("Quandl")

The `quandl` (or `quandlget`) function takes one positional argument and currently supports six keyword arguments, `order`, `rows`, `period`, `transformation`, `auth_key` and `format`. The positional argument is the Quandl code for the database you wish to download. Example:


````julia
julia> quandl("GOOG/NASDAQ_QQQ") 
100x5 TimeArray{Float64,2} 2013-12-31 to 2014-05-23

             Open   High   Low    Close  Volume

DataFrame support is already implemented for this method, being enough to call the function with an argument `fomat="DataFrame"`. Example

```julia
julia> quandl("GOOG/NASDAQ_QQQ", format="DataFrame")
100x6 DataFrame

You can also search using the `quandlsearch` function. Currently, this function supports one positional argument (the string you are searching for), and four keyword arguments, `page` (the page returned by the search), `results` (the number of the results per-page) and `format` (the type of the object returned by the function). This function return an array containing dictionaries, each one representing one search result. Example:

```julia
julia> s = quandlsearch("GDP USA"); # Here 's' is an array of dictionaries

julia> s[1] # This first dictionary looks ugly on REPL
["from_date"=>"1960-12-31","code"=>"USA_NY_GDP_MKTP_CN","name"=>"United States: GDP (current LCU)","source_code"=>"WORLDBANK","id"=>2582933,"updated_at"=>"2014-05-17T12:32:40Z","private"=>false,"description"=>"GDP at purchaser's prices is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products.

julia> s[1]["name"]

```

Better formated search result is on the plans
